# Restflow - powerful rest apps with your flow

Restflow is a JVM targeted framework used to build high performance, 
and easily deployable rest apis and microservices.


## Main objectives
    
    High performance apis
    Easily scalable


## Architecture

Restflow was built using [vertx](https://vertx.io/), [hazelcast](https://hazelcast.com/) and a very easy to understand nonblocking architecture.
    The architecture adopted allows restflow to easily scale from a single to a multitude of commodity hardware.

## Tests
